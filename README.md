# aardvark_chrome_extension

This is a very simple wrapper around the Aardvark Bookmarklet, found here:

http://www.karmatics.com/aardvark/bookmarklet.html

Note that I'm not in any way affiliated with Karmatics or Aardvark, but liked the bookmarklet, and wanted it to work in places where modern browser security checks (Content Security Policies) were stopping it from working.

How does it work?
- Install the extension by cloning this repo to your machine and loading it under `chrome://extensions`
- Go to a page you want to use it on
- Click on the `Aardvark` button in the toolbar.
- Move your cursor around the page, and you'll see items highlighted. Press `Ctrl+h` for help.
- Note that I changed it so you need to press the "Control" key to do any Aardvark operations, so for example wider is now `Ctrl+w` instead of just `w`.
- Any errors are probably mine of course!
